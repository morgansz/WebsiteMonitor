## Implementation approach:
For this project, we can use the following open-source tools and frameworks:
- Flask: A lightweight web framework for creating user interfaces and handling HTTP requests.
- APScheduler: A library for scheduling periodic tasks, which can be used to periodically check the availability of a website.
- Requests: A library for making HTTP requests, which can be used to check the availability of a website.
- SMTP: The built-in SMTP library in Python for sending email notifications.
- SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for working with databases, which can be used to store the history of website checks and notifications.

## Python package name:
