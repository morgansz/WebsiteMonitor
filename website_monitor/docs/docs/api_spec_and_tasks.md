## Required Python third-party packages:

```python
"""
flask==1.1.2
bcrypt==3.2.0
"""
```

## Required Other language third-party packages:

```python

No third-party ...

```

## Full API spec:

```python
"""
openapi: 3.0.0
...
description: A JSON object ...
"""
```

## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the application"),
    ("config.py", "Contains configuration variables for the application"),
    ("models.py", "Contains the data models for the application"),
    ("scheduler.py", "Contains the scheduler logic for periodic website checks"),
    ("utils.py", "Contains utility functions for the application"),
    ("views.py", "Contains the views and routes for the application")
]
```

The task dependencies are as follows:
1. `config.py` should be implemented first as it contains the configuration variables needed by other modules.
2. `models.py` should be implemented next as it defines the data models used by other modules.
3. `utils.py` should be implemented next as it contains utility functions that may be used by other modules.
4. `scheduler.py` should be implemented next as it contains the logic for scheduling periodic website checks.
5. `views.py` should be implemented next as it contains the views and routes for the application.
6. `main.py` should be implemented last as it contains the main entry point of the application.

## Task list:

```python
[
    "config.py",
    "models.py",
    "utils.py",
    "scheduler.py",
    "views.py",
    "main.py"
]
```
